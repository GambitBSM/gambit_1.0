DarkBit TODO list
=================


Reminder about primary goals from Gambit III
--------------------------------------------

The agreed on deadline for these tasks: Oct 2014

- Physics
    - Gamma-rays: dwarfs (1/2 finished), lines (0 finished), GC (1/2 finished)
    - nu from Sun & IceCube (1/2 finished)
    - DD Lux (3/4 finished), CDMS
    - Relic density (3/4 finished)

- Backends
    - DarkSUSY, DONE
    - MicrOMEGAS, DONE
    - NuLike, DONE
    - optional: 
        - SuperIsoRelic
        - simpleCR


What we have 
------------

1200 lines of DarkBit.cpp, with

- Rudimentary calculation of dNdE_gam
- Relic density calculation (abstracted and simple)
- Backends to
    - DDCalc
    - DS
    - micromegas
    - nulike
- Coupling to direct detection codes
- Robust coupling to nulike


List with *necessary* tasks for first DarkBit version
-----------------------------------------------------

- Remove initialization functions from DarkBit --> backends
- Use doxygen for starting a manual
- Finish dNdE_gam annihilation yields from DS (include VIB, lines, etc)
- Finish annihilation catalogue
- Cross-checks between relic density from DarkSUSY and Micromegas
- Simple OmegaDM likelihood function with different values from the literature
- Write printer for BaseFunction object (to dump e.g. gamma-ray spectra)
- Finish and check coupling to Chris' LUX likelihood code
- Make neutrino IceCube likelihoods optional in the inifile
- Calculation of neutrino spectra with DarkSUSY
- Construct void pointer interface to nulike (for feeding in basefunction
  objects)
- Check direct detection coupling definitions
- Backend fermilike
- Use farrays for DarkSUSY relic density solver
- Make use of print functions, once completed
- Make use error system, once there
- Implementation of minimal model (singlet DM) for prototypical model and
  cross-section definitions etc.
- J-value calculations

- Many validation tests
- Writing the paper with e.g.
    - systematic comparison of relic density results
    - comparison of various ID limits on simple benchmark models (e.g. the GeV
      excess?)


Long-term wishlist
------------------

- Backending SuperIsoRelic
- Make RD codes adaptive to other sources for Weff etc
- Lars' p-/e+ propagation codes
- PPPC (tables only?)
- CR data (PAMELA, AMS-02 etc)
- Planck, ATC, BESS, WMAP pol, HST... (CosmoBit)
- Astrophysical probes in general (stars, DM self-interaction)
- Implementation of CMB limits (starting with codes from singlet paper)
- Astrophysical DM distributions (substucture & phase space)
- Decaying dark matter
- Asymmetric dark matter
