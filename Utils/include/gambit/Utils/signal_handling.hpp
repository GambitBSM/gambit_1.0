///  GAMBIT signal handling functions
///
///  I have tried to make these standards
///  conformant, however I suspect that they are
///  not, and the emergency signal handlers
///  definitely are not. Nevertheless, they seem
///  to work well, and the emergency shutdown
///  handlers are intended for emergencies only
///  (when a clean shutdown is not possible), so
///  non-conformance is the least of our problems
///  in that situation.
///  The "soft" shutdown handler should be at
///  least very close to conformant I think,
///  though there are some more steps that could
///  be taken to improve this if it turns out to
///  be an issue.
