twalk: |
  #remove_newlines
  The twalk sampler is an ensemble MCMC.  It is a multiple chain MCMC that advances each
  chain by jumping over or away from a current point in another chain.  This
  implementation also mixes in normal "Gaussian" jumps to add variability.  Metropolis-Hastings
  jumps are done on a random lower dimension subspace of the full parameter space.
  The Gelman-Rubin statistic is used as the second moment convergence criterion.
  This implementation is based on the algorithm developed by Christen and Fox:

      kwalk_ratio (0.9836):      The ratio of kwalk jumps to Gaussian jumps.
      projection_dimension (4):  The dimension of the space being projected onto.
      gaussian_distance (2.4):   The distance of the Gaussian jump.
      walk_distance: (2.5):      The distance of the kwalk jump over a point.
      transverse_distance (6.0): The distance of the kwalk jump away from a point.

multinest: |
  #remove_newlines
  MultiNest is a nested sampling algorithm that calculates the evidence and
  explores the posterior.  It continuously updates a random set of "live" points
  by removing the point of lowest likelihood and replaces to with a point of
  greater likelihood.  The MultiNest algorithm improves the efficiency by
  encapsulating these live points with ellipsoids.  This implementation uses
  code developed by Feroz et. al.:  http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.3437

  YAML options (defaults):
      IS (1):          do Nested Importance Sampling?
      mmodal (1):      do mode separation?
      ceff (0):        run in constant efficiency mode?
      nlive (1000):    number of live points
      efr (0.8):       set the required efficiency
      tol (0.5):       tol, defines the stopping criteria
      nClsPar (dim):   No. of parameters to do mode separation on. Default set to parameter dimension.
  #remove_newlines
      updInt (1000):   after how many iterations feedback is required & the output
  files should be updated (*10 for dumper)
  #dont_remove_newlines
      Ztol (-1E90):    all the modes with logZ < Ztol are ignored
      maxModes (100):  expected max no. of modes (used only for memory allocation)
      seed (-1):       random no. generator seed, if < 0 then take the seed from system clock
      fb (1):          need feedback on standard output?
      resume (1):      resume from a previous job?
      outfile (0):     write output files?
      logZero (-1E90): points with loglike < logZero will be ignored by MultiNest
      maxiter (0):     Max no. of iterations, a non-positive value means infinity.

  Auxillary output variables:
      Posterior:    Statistical weight of each point.
      live_points:  Boolean, true if the point is a live point.  False otherwise.

raster: |
  #remove_newlines
  The raster scanner prints a user-defined set of points.  Any non-specified parameters will be randomly chosen and transformed by the priors.  Note that any specified point must use the "none"
  prior.  The parameters can be specified with a number or vector.  Different parameters can have
  different vector lengths.  If different lengths are specified, then the values of parameters with short
  vector lengths will be repeated.

  Inifile options:
      like:         The purpose to use for the likelihood.
      parameters:   The parameters specified by the user.

  Example YAML file entry:

    raster_example:
      plugin: raster
      like: LogLike
      parameters:
        "model::param_1": [0, 1]
        "model::param_2": 0.5

  #remove_newlines
  The Grenoble Analysis Toolkit (GreAT) is a flexible C++ framework for statistical analyses. In order to provide efficient handling and plotting of the data, GreAT is interfaced with the ROOT package developed at CERN. The GreAT package comes with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian parameter inference. The implemented Metropolis-Hastings algorithms use different proposal functions. In the current version of the GreAT interface implemented in GAMBIT, only the multivariate Gaussian distribution is used where the covariance matrix can be automatically re-evaluated after each chain from all previous processed chains. To obtain a reliable estimate of the PDF, the chain analysis is based on the selection of a subset of points from the chains. Some steps at the beginning of the chain are discarded (burn-in length), in order to forget the random starting point. By construction, each step of the chain is correlated with the previous steps: sets of independent samples are obtained by thinning the chain (over the correlation length). The final results of the MCMC analysis are obtained by merely counting the number of samples within the related region of parameter space.

  GreAT YAML options:
      nTrialLists:    The number of trial lists (Markov Chains)
      nTrials:        The number of trials (steps in the parameter space per trial list)

  Auxillary output variables:
      multiplicity:    Statistical weight (multiplicity) of each point

      like:            Use the functors thats corresponds to the specified purpose.

square_grid: |
  Simple grid scanner where each dimension of grid are identical.  Evaluation points along a user-defined grid.

  YAML options:
      grid_pts[req'd]: The number of points along each dimension on the grid.
      like:            Use the functors thats corresponds to the specified purpose.

random: |
  Simple scanner that randomly chooses points.

  YAML options (defaults):
      point_number(1000):  The number of points to be randomly selected.  Default is 1000.
      like:                Use the functors thats corresponds to the specified purpose.

toy_mcmc: |
  #remove_newlines

  and is then accepted or rejected based on the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probablity.

  YAML options:
      point_number(1000):  The number of accepted points.  Default is 1000.
      like:                Use the functors thats corresponds to the specified purpose.

  Auxillary output variables:
      mult:     Multiplicity (weight) of each point.


postprocessor: |
  #remove_newlines
  This plugin reads a series of samples computed in some previous scan, and computes additional likelihoods or observables for them. Log-likelihoods for the original samples may be added to or subtracted from a newly-computed contribution, allowing existing likelihood constraints to be replaced or new ones added to previously-completed scans.  Like the simple scanners, the postprocessor uses MPI to divide its objective calculations evenly between available processes.

  #remove_newlines
  The yaml setup required to run the postprocessor spans two sections of the master \YAML file
  -- the usual Scanner section, plus also the Parameters section. It should be noted that
  parameter that are being postprocessed should be assigned the "none" prior.  In the Scanner
  section, the options [and defaults] are as follows:

  #remove_newlines
  like:                  The purpose to use as the objective; should generally match the purpose set for likelihood components.
  #dont_remove_newlines

  reweighted_like:       The output label used for the final result of 'add_to_like' and 'subtract_from_like' operations.

  #remove_newlines
  add_to_like[]:         A vector of names of datasets present in the input samples, presumably
  log-likelihood values, to be added to the newly computed \yaml{like} and output as
  'reweighted_like'.  (Note that the `newly-computed' 'like' may be zero if no entries in the
  'ObsLike' section have been assigned a purpose that matches 'like'). For example, if the
  combined likelihood of a previous scan were labelled "LogLike", and one were to choose "like: New_LogLike" as the new composite (log-)likelihood for a new `scan', then the way to ensure
  that the old and the new composite log-likelihoods were automatically summed for every model
  point would be to set "add_to_like: [LogLike]". The results of this summation would appear in
  the new output with the label by 'reweighted_like'.
  #dont_remove_newlines

  #remove_newlines
  subtract_from_like[]:  As per 'add_to_like', except the old output is subtracted from 'like'.
  permit_discard_old_likes[false]: When set to \yaml{false}, this option forbids the purpose
  chosen for 'like' from clashing with any data label in the input samples. For example: if the
  original purpose was "LogLike", a different purpose must be chosen for 'like', or an error
  will be thrown. If this option is set "true", then clashes are permitted, and will be
  resolved in the new output by replacing the old data with the newly-computed data (as occurs
  automatically for all other clashes between old and new dataset names). This option also
  applies to likelihood components listed in 'add_to_like', 'subtract_from_like', and
  'reweighted_like'. If set to "false" then these names may not be recomputed during
  postprocessing.
  #dont_remove_newlines

  update_interval[1000]: Defines the number of iterations between messages reporting on the progress of the postprocessing.

  #remove_newlines
  reader:                Options under this item specify the format of the old output file to
  be read, along with the path at which the file is located. The required options differ
  depending on which 'printer' was used to save the results of the previous scan.
  #dont_remove_newlines

  #remove_newlines
  The final option, 'reader', is used to inform the postprocessor of the format and location of the old data that needs to
  be reprocessed.  For files created with the hdf5 printer:

  type:  hdf5
  file:  Path to the HDF5 file containing the data to be parsed
  group: Group within the HDF5 file containing datasets to be parsed.

  For ascii output:

  type:          ascii
  data_filename: Path to the ASCII file containing the data to be parsed
  info_filename: Path to the ASCII `header' file that contains the labelling information for the columns of 'data_filename'.

  #remove_newlines
  Note that the 'reader' need not match the chosen 'printer' in a postprocessing run; reading
  samples in "ascii" and outputting updated samples in "hdf5", or vice versa, is permitted.
  This allows Gambit samples produced in one format to be easily converted into any other
  format.

diver: |
  #remove_newlines
  Diver is a differential evolution (DE) optimization package that is also highly effective at sampling parameter spaces.
  DE works by evolving a population of points in parameter space, with successive generations chosen by a form of
  vector addition between members of the current population.  As descibed in the Gambit paper, this implementation

      lambda[0.0]:                        Mixing factor between best and rand/current.
      current[false]:                     Use current vector for mutation.
      expon[false]:                       Use exponential crossover.
      bndry[3]:                           Boundary constraint: 1=brick wall, 2=random re-initialization, 3=reflection.
      jDE[true]:                          Use self-adaptive choices for rand/1/bin parameters as per Brest et al 2006.
      lambdajDE[true]:                    Use self-adaptive rand-to-best/1/bin parameters; based on Brest et al 2006.

      max_initialisation_attempts[10000]: Maximum number of times to try to find a valid vector for each slot in the initial population.

  #remove_newlines
  max_acceptable_value[0.9999*min]:   Maximum function value to accept for the initial generation if init_population_strategy > 0.
  Here "min" is the valued extracted from key values section of the main yaml file corresponding to the
  "likelihood: model_invalid_for_lnlike_below" tag.
  #dont_remove_newlines
