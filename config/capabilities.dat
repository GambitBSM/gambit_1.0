# GAMBIT will parse this file and try to match the entries
# to the capabilities it has registered. If there are any
# conflicts it will report them, and if any capabilities
# are lacking descriptions those will be reported too.
# This is then merged with internally known information
# to create a centralised database of capability
# information.
# This is found in the file "<insert name here>"

# Note: Yaml syntax for multi-line strings is this:

#body: |
#  This is a multi-line string.
#  "special" metacharacters may
#  appear here. The extent of this string is
