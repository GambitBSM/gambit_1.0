Short description:
  BOSS is a tool for turning a C++ code into a suitable
  GAMBIT backend, including dynamic loading of classes.



Requirements:
-------------

gccxml: 
  For parsing C++ code BOSS makes use of the tool 'gccxml',
  available from http://gccxml.github.io. 

  On many Linux systems gccxml can be installed via the 
  following command: apt-get install gccxml



Quick guide:
------------

1. Edit the settings in modules/cfg.py.
   
   This is where you specify what classes and functions BOSS should
   try to make available from GAMBIT, and provide further information
   about the C++ code, such as paths and file extensions.


2. Run BOSS: ./boss.py [options] <input files>
   
   <input files> is a list of C++ header or source files that contain
   the requested classes and functions. It is sufficient that declarations
   of the classes/functions are reachable through a chain of C++ include
   statements. Thus, if there is one "main" header that includes most
   other parts of the code, it will usually be sufficient to list only
   this file.

   Example: ./boss.py path_to_Pythia/include/Pythia8/Pythia.h

   To list the available command line options, run: ./boss.py --help


3. When BOSS has finished, a list of further instructions on how to make
   the backend accessible from GAMBIT is shown.



Limitations:
------------

First of all, any limitation of gccxml will automatically also be a limitation of BOSS.
As gccxml cannot properly parse some of the new C++11 syntax, BOSS will not be able to
understand such code. (However, see the section 'Future plans' below.)

To accomplish dynamic loading of classes while maintaining the original class interface,
BOSS constructs a "wrapper class" for every loaded class. This wrapper class type is
shared by both the backend library and GAMBIT. However, there are several scenarios that
BOSS cannot yet deal with properly, either because of limitations in gccxml or due to
challenges related to this wrapper class system. In such cases BOSS will usually be able
to generate functioning code, but there will be no interface to the problematic elements.
The limitations most commonly encountered are:

- Class members that make use of another class that is not loaded.

- Class member variables that are of type pointer-to-loaded-class.

- Function pointers.

- Templated classes and functions.

- Arrays containing a loaded class.

Often the limitations can easily be overcome by small additions to the C++ code.
For instance, if a class contains a member variable 'x_arr' that is an array containing 
instances of some loaded type 'X', BOSS cannot generate an interface to the 'x_arr' variable.
However, if the original class also contains some simple interface functions, e.g. 
  
  X& get_x(int i)  { return x_arr[i]; }

and

  void set_x(int i, X x_in) { x_arr[i] = x_in; },

BOSS will happily generate an interface to these functions, allowing the user to access the
content of 'x_arr'.



Future plans:
-------------

Several of the current limitations of BOSS are due to limitations in gccxml. However, gccxml 
was recently superseeded by a new tool 'CastXML'. The development of CastXML is supposed to
follow that of new compilers more closely compared to what has been the case for gccxml.
Among other things, this implies the ability to parse new C++11 syntax. Future versions of BOSS 
will therefore most probably be based CastXML, with the expectation that this will help
extend the current functionality.
