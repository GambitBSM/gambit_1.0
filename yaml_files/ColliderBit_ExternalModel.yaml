## GAMBIT configuration for running ColliderBit on a single parameter
## point of a user-specified BSM model
##
## Note that a more appropriate alternative for running single points
## through ColliderBit is to use the ColliderBit_standalone program.
## See the ColliderBit paper for details on how this works.
##
## In this example, the new model is *not* implemented properly in
## GAMBIT. Rather, we use a dummy model to bypass the full model
## machinery in GAMBIT and simply pass the parameter point of interest
## to Pythia via an SLHA file. We use a version of the Pythia backend
## (Pythia 8.212.EM) extended with matrix elements for the new model.
## See the main ColliderBit paper for details on the example BSM model
## and how to replace it with a different one.
##
## Note: GAMBIT must be told to use Pythia 8.212.EM. Do this by specifying
##       "8_212_EM" as the "Default_Pythia" in the file
##       /Backends/include/gambit/Backends/default_bossed_versions.hpp

Parameters:

  # GAMBIT won't run without a proper GAMBIT model. Here we just provide a dummy
  # model (TestModel1D) that satisfies GAMBIT requirements in a minimal way.
  # The model is not used by Pythia or ColliderBit in any way.
  TestModel1D:
    x:
      prior_type: flat
      range: [0, 1]


Printer:

  # These lines tell GAMBIT to use the hdf5 printer.
  # Switch to the ascii printer by commenting out and
  # using the ascii lines below.
  printer: hdf5

  options:
    output_file: "External.hdf5"
    group: "/External"
    delete_file_on_restart: true

  # printer: ascii

  # options:
  #   output_file: "gambit_output.txt"


Scanner:

  # Use the random scanner to run a single point.
  # Note that the sampled TestModel1D parameter is not used for anything,
  # all that happens is that Pythia is run with the SLHA file provided below

Rules:

  # The current capability structure allows for the user to mix'n'match
  # collider settings, detector sims and analyses. The user may run BuckFastATLAS
  # with ATLAS analyses, BuckFastCMS with CMS analyses, and Delphes with any analyses,
  # for various configurations of Pythia.
  #
  # The way to turn the detectors on or off is via the boolean option useDetector for
  # the module functions getDelphes, getBuckFastATLAS and getBuckFastCMS.
