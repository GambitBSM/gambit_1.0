##########################################################################
## GAMBIT example configuration for the scanner system.
##
## This example configures ScannerBit to explore a EggBox likelihood using
## the multinest sampler.  Also include are instructions to use other
## likelihoods and scanners.
##########################################################################


Parameters:

  # None -- we're using ScannerBit's built-in objective functions in this example


Priors:

  # Specify the priors, the parameters they work with, and any options as needed for that prior.
  # A prior object is built for every entry here (along with any coming from 'ranges' keywords above),
  # and then they are combined into a "composite" prior.


Printer:

  # Select printer to use via string tag)
  #printer: ascii
  printer: hdf5

  # This options node is passed on wholesale to
  # the printer object; required options may
  # therefore vary according to the selected
  # printer.
  options:
    # Name of info file (explains content of output file)
    #info_file: "runs/spartan/samples/gambit_output2.info"
    # Name of output file
    output_file: "gambit_output.hdf5"
    group: "/test"
    delete_file_on_restart: true


Scanner:

  # This tag specifies which plugin(s) to use as likelihood functions
  # Here the EggBox likelihood is chosen, but you could choose the
  # EggBox and a gaussian ([EggBox, gaussian]) as defined under
  # the objectives section
  use_objectives: EggBox #[EggBox, gaussian]

  # This tag specifies which plugin to use as the scanner.
  # Here the multinest scanner is choosen, but you could
  # choose any scanner defined under the scanners section
  use_scanner: multinest #twalk
