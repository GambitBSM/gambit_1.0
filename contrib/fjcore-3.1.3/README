// fjcore -- extracted from FastJet v3.1.3 (http://fastjet.fr)
//
// fjcore constitutes a digest of the main FastJet functionality.
// The files fjcore.hh and fjcore.cc are meant to provide easy access to these 
// core functions, in the form of single files and without the need of a full 
// FastJet installation:
//
//     g++ main.cc fjcore.cc
// 
// with main.cc including fjcore.hh.
//
// The results are expected to be identical to those obtained by linking to
// the full FastJet distribution.
//
// NOTE THAT, IN ORDER TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR FJCORE AND THE FULL FASTJET
// TO COEXIST, THE FORMER USES THE "fjcore" NAMESPACE INSTEAD OF "fastjet". 
//
// In particular, fjcore provides:
//
//   - access to all native pp and ee algorithms, kt, anti-kt, C/A.
//     For C/A, the NlnN method is available, while anti-kt and kt
//     are limited to the N^2 one (still the fastest for N < 100k particles)
//   - access to selectors, for implementing cuts and selections
//   - access to all functionalities related to pseudojets (e.g. a jet's
//     structure or user-defined information)
//
// Instead, it does NOT provide:
//
//   - jet areas functionality
//   - background estimation
//   - access to other algorithms via plugins
//   - interface to CGAL
//   - fastjet tools, e.g. filters, taggers
//
// If these functionalities are needed, the full FastJet installation must be
// used. The code will be fully compatible, with the sole replacement of the
// header files and of the fjcore namespace with the fastjet one.
//
// fjcore.hh and fjcore.cc are not meant to be human-readable.
// For documentation, see the full FastJet manual and doxygen at http://fastjet.fr
