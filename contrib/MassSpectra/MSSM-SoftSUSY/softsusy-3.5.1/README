QUICK INSTALLATION AND RUN TEST
-------------------------------

See the "INSTALL" file in this directory for installation instructions. 

There are five C++ test programs, four of which can be run by the commands 
> ./softsusy.x
> ./rpvsoftsusy.x 
> ./rpvneut.x
> ./softsusy-nmssm.x
The output from these commands can be checked against outputTest,
rpvOutputTest, neutOutputTest and respectively.

You can run the SUSY Les Houches Accord input provided by running the commands
> ./softpoint.x leshouches < lesHouchesInput
> ./softpoint.x leshouches < slha2Input
> ./softpoint.x leshouches < rpvHouchesInput
You may check the output of these commands against the output files
lesHouchesOutput, slha2Output and rpvHouchesOutput, respectively, that are
provided with the SOFTSUSY distribution

Alternatively, run with command line inputs, for example
> ./softpoint.x nmssm sugra --m0=125 --m12=125 --a0=-300 --tanBeta=10
--lambda=0.1 --lambdaAt Msusy

See the manual (in the doc/ subdirectory) threeLoop.pdf for instructions on
how to switch two-loop threshold corrections/three loop RGEs at run-time, once
they've been compiled. 

INTRODUCTION
------------

The most recent version of SOFTSUSY and full documentation can be obtained
from: http://softsusy.hepforge.org/

This program provides a SUSY spectrum in the NMSSM, or the MSSM including
flavour violation and with or without R-parity consistent with input Standard
Model fermion mass/mixings and electroweak/strong coupling data. The R-parity
violating mode can calculate neutrino masses and mixings to 1 loop.

CALCULATING DECAYS IN THE NMSSM
-------------------------------

To link with NMSSMTools, so that SOFTSUSY NMSSM output can be piped through it
(to calculate decays, for example), you'll need to download and
NMSSMTools. Then, you can link it using by running 
> ./setup_nmssmtools.sh --nmssmtools-dir=/path/to/NMSSMTools --compile 
After this, there will be an additional executable ./softsusy_nmssmtools.x
that calculates the spectrum with SOFTSUSY, and decays with NMSSMTools. It can
be run by (for example): 
> ./softsusy_nmssmools.x leshouches < inOutFiles/nmssmSLHAnoZ3Input 
If you use it, you should of course provide the proper citations to
NMSSMTools. Using the program in this mode, you should make sure in the SLHA
input file that Block SOFTSUSY variables 15 and 17 are set to 1.
